# Deployment Project (Vercel-like System)

This project is a simplified implementation of a Vercel-like deployment system.
The base architecture was inspired by an open-source project, and I am extending
and modifying it to understand how real-world deployment platforms work.

## What this project does
- Handles frontend builds
- Uploads build artifacts
- Routes requests to deployed projects
- Manages deployment services

## Why I built this
To deeply understand:
- CI/CD fundamentals
- Deployment pipelines
- Request routing
- Backend service orchestration
